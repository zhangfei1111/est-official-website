Data subjects may contact our Data Protection Officer or other controller employees at any time to exercise their right of confirmation.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12px;">b) Right to access</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> &nbsp; &nbsp;Each data subject shall have the right to obtain information about their personal data, regardless of the time of storage, and to obtain copies of such information free of charge. The US and European directives and regulations have also entitled data subjects with the rights to obtain the following information: purposes of the process; types of such personal information; receivers or types of receivers whose personal data have been or are going to be disclosed, especially receivers in other countries or receivers of international organizations; the expected storage period of personal data (if possible), or when such period is impossible to obtain, the criteria to determine such a period; whether data subjects have the right to request controllers to modify or delete their personal data, or to restrict the processing of any personal data of data subjects, or to object to such processing; the right to file a complaint to the regulating authorities; and if personal data were not collected from data subjects themselves, any useful information about the data sources.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12px;">c) Right to rectify</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> &nbsp; &nbsp;As authorized by the US and European legislators, each data subject shall have the right to rectify any of their incorrect personal data held by data controllers in a timely manner. Considering the purposes of the processing, data subjects have the right to complete any incomplete personal data, including by providing supplemental statements. If data subjects wish to exercise this right of rectification, they may contact our Data Protection Officer or other controller employees at any time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12px;">d) Right to delete (Right to be forgotten)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> &nbsp; &nbsp;As authorized by the US and European legislators, each data subject shall have the right to ask their data controllers to delete any personal data about them in a timely manner. Data subjects shall withdraw their consent on which the processing is based in accordance with Article 6(1)(a) or Article 9(2)(a) of the GDPR, and there shall be no other legal basis for the processing. Data subjects object to the processing in accordance with Article 21(1) of the GDPR, and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or data subjects object to the processing in accordance with Article 21(2). Personal data have been processed illegally. Personal data must be deleted to ensure that controllers comply with their legal obligations as stated by the laws of the alliance or any member states. Personal data collected must be related to the provision of informational social services as described in Article 8(1) of the GDPR.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> &nbsp; &nbsp;If any of the above apply, and data subjects wish to delete their personal data stored by Solar AI Technologies LLC, they may contact our Data Protection Officer or other controller employees at any time. The Data Protection Officer or other employees at Solar AI Technologies LLC must comply with the request for deletion without delay and shall notify all positions that are engaged in the processing of personal data of the request. If users wish to delete data on their own, they may do so by canceling their account by going to [Basic settings] - [User's information settings] - [Delete account].</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> &nbsp; &nbsp;If controllers have already made the personal data public and are required to delete such personal data in accordance with Article 17(1), they shall consider available technologies and the costs of implementation and take reasonable measures, including technical measures, to notify other controllers who process personal data requested by data subjects that such controllers delete any links, reproductions or copies of such personal data where such processing is not required. Under specific circumstances, the Data Protection Officer or other employees at Solar AI Technologies LLC may arrange necessary measures.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> &nbsp; &nbsp;When end-users submit their request to delete their personal data to Solar AI or delete personal data on their own, any private personal data held by Solar AI at its installers/distributors/service providers shall also be deleted. For cases in which Solar AI acts as the processor only and not the data controller, Solar AI will notify the data controllers of the User's request to delete data by email and phone.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12px;">e) Right to restrict data processing</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> &nbsp; &nbsp;Each data subject shall possess the right, as granted by the US and European legislators, to restrict the data controller from processing his/her personal data, in any one of the following cases:</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> &nbsp; &nbsp;The data subject questions the accuracy of their personal data; the data controller can verify the accuracy of personal data within a certain time limit. The data processing is illegal, and the data subject requests that the use of personal data be restricted, rather than deletion.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12px;">Personal data for processing purposes are no longer required by the data controller, but continue to be required by the data subject, in order to establish, exercise, or defend a legal claim. The data subject has objected to processing data under Article 21(1) of the GDPR, and is awaiting confirmation of whether the legal grounds of the data controller will take precedence over his/her own.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> &nbsp; &nbsp;A data subject who requests restrictions upon the processing of personal data stored by Solar AI Technologies LLC in any one of the above cases may contact our Data Protection Officer or another employee. One of these will make arrangements to restrict data processing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12px;">f) Right to data portability</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> &nbsp; &nbsp;Each data subject shall possess the right, as granted by the US and European legislators, to receive their personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format from the data controller. The data subject shall have the right to transfer such data to another data controller without hindrance by the data controller providing the data, provided that such data are processed based on consent given under Article 6(1)(a) or Article 9(2)(a) of the GDPR, or under a contract entered into pursuant to Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR, and the data are automatically processed, unless the processing is necessary for tasks performed in the public interest or the exercise of the data controller’s official authority. In addition, in exercising his/her right to data portability under Article 20(1) of the GDPR, each data subject shall possess the right to have his/her personal data directly transferred from one controller to another, provided that doing so is technically feasible and will not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.

This also applies to analyses made based on these provisions. In case of objection by a data subject, Solar AI Technologies LLC will cease to process his/her personal data, unless we can establish persuasive legal grounds for the processing of such data that take precedence over the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject, or for the purpose of establishing, exercising or defending legitimate claims.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> &nbsp; &nbsp;In addition, each data subject shall have the right to object, on grounds related to their particular circumstances, to the processing of their personal data by Solar AI Technologies LLC for scientific, historical research or statistical purposes, under Article 89 (1) of the GDPR, unless this processing is necessary for tasks performed in the public interest.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> &nbsp; &nbsp;In order to exercise the right to object, a data subject may contact the Data Protection Officer or other employees of Solar AI Technologies LLC directly.
